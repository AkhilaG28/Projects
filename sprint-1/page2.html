        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>The spacecraft bus carries the payload. Its subsystems support the payload and helps in pointing the payload
            correctly. It puts the payload in the right orbit and keeps it there. It provides housekeeping functions. It
            also provides orbit and attitude maintenance, electric power, command, telemetry and data handling,
            structure and rigidity, temperature control, data storage and communication, if required. The payload and
            spacecraft bus may be different units or it may be a combined one. The booster adapter provides the
            load-carrying interface with the vehicle (payload and spacecraft bus together).
        </p>
        <p> The spacecraft may also have a propellant load, which is used to drive or push the vehicle upwards, and a
            propulsion kick stage. The propellant commonly used is a compressed gas like nitrogen, liquid such as
            monopropellant hydrazine or solid fuel, which is used for velocity corrections and attitude control. In a
            kick stage (also called apogee boost motor, propulsion module, or integral propulsion stage) a separate
            rocket motor is used to send the spacecraft into its mission orbit. While designing a spacecraft, the orbit
            which is going to be used should be considered into the point as it affects attitude control, thermal
            design, and the electric power subsystem. But these effects are secondary as compared to the effect caused
            on the payload due to the orbit. Thus while designing the mission; the designer selects such an orbit which
            increases the payload performance. The designer even calculates the required spacecraft performance
            characteristics such as pointing, thermal control, power quantity, and duty cycle. The spacecraft is then
            made, which satisfies all the requirements.</p>

        <h2>Attitude Determination and Control</h2>
        <p>The attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS) is used to change the attitude (orientation) of the
            spacecraft. There are some external torques acting on the spacecraft along the axis passing through its
            center of gravity which can reorient the ship in any direction or can give it a spin. The ADCS nullifies
            these torques by applying equal and opposite torques using the propulsion and navigation subsystems. Moment
            of inertia of the body is to be calculated to determine the external torques which also requires
            determination of vehicle's absolute attitude using sensors. The property called 'gyroscopic stiffness' is
            used to reduce the spinning effect. The simplest spacecraft achieve control by spinning or interacting with
            the Earth's magnetic or gravity fields. Sometimes they are uncontrolled. Spacecraft may have several bodies
            or they are attached to important parts, such as solar arrays or communication antennas which need
            individual attitude pointing. For controlling the appendage's attitude, actuators are often used, with
            separate sensors and controllers. The various types of control techniques used are:[citation needed]

        <pre>
            Passive Control Techniques.
            Spin Control Techniques.
            Three-axis Control Techniques.

        <h2>Telemetry, tracking, and command</h2>
        <p>Telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) is used for communication between spacecraft and the ground systems.
            The subsystem functions are:
        </p>
        <pre>
            Controlling of spacecraft by the operator on Earth
            Receive the uplink commands, process and send them to other subsystems for implication.
            Receive the downlink commands from subsystems, process and transmit them to Earth.
            Inform constantly about the spacecraft position

        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>
            The process of sending information towards the spacecraft is called uplink or forward link and the opposite
            process is called downlink or return link. Uplink consists of commands and ranging tones where as downlink
            consists of status telemetry, ranging tones and even may include payload data. Receiver, transmitter and a
            wide-angle (hemispheric or omnidirectional) antenna are the main components of a basic communication
            subsystem. Systems with high data rates may even use a directional antenna, if required. The subsystem can
            provide us with the coherence between uplink and downlink signals, with the help of which we can measure
            range-rate Doppler shifts. The communication subsystem is sized by data rate, allowable error rate,
            communication path length, and RF frequency.

        <h2>Power</h2>
        <p>The electrical power subsystem (EPS) consists of 4 subunits</p>
        <pre>
            Power Source (Battery, solar cell, fuelcells, thermoelectric couple)
            Storage unit (No. of batteries in series)
            Power Distribution (Cabling, switching, shock protection)
            Power Regulation and Control (To prevent battery overcharging and overheating)
        </pre>
        <br>
        <h2>Thermal</h2>
        <p>Thermal control subsystem (TCS) is used to maintain the temperature of all spacecraft components within
            certain limits. Both upper and lower limits are defined for each component. There are two limits, namely,
            operational (in working conditions) and survival (in non-working conditions). Temperature is controlled by
            using insulators, radiators, heaters, louvers and by giving proper surface finish to components</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Propulsion</h2>
        <p>The main function of the propulsion subsystem is to provide thrust so as to change the spacecraft's
            translational velocity or to apply torques to change its angular momentum. There is no requirement of thrust
            and hence even no requirement of propulsion equipment in a simplest spacecraft. But many of them need a
            controlled thrust in their system, so their design includes some form of metered propulsion (a propulsion
            system that can be turned on and off in small increments). Thrusting is used for the following purposes: for
            changing the orbital parameters, to control attitude during thrusting, correct velocity errors, maneuver,
            counter disturbance forces (e.g., drag), and control and correct angular momentum. The propulsion subsystem
            includes a propellant, tankage, distribution system, pressurant, and propellant controls. It also includes
            thrusters or engines.</p>
