        <h1>SATELLITE STATS</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Of the 2,062 active artificial satellites orbiting the Earth as of March 31, 2019, 901 belong to the United
            States. This is by far the largest number of any single country, with their nearest competitor, China,
            accounting for only 299</p>
        <p>But to put things in perspective, what would be the exact number of satellites that will revolve around the
            earth’s orbit many of you must be wondering.

            <p>As per the Index of Objects Launched into Outer Space which is prepared by the United Nations Office for
                Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), 4,987 satellites revolved around the Earth’s orbit during the start of
                this year. The number of satellites revolving around the Earth showed an increase of 2.68% as compared
                to last year.</p>
            <p>UNOOSA observed that in 2018, 382 objects were launched into space, while in 2017 453 objects were
                launched, making 2017 a year of record launches. The decrease in number of launches in 2017 could be
                attributed to the fact that Planet has fulfilled its objective of imaging Earth’s landmass on a daily
                basis and now the company’s focus is on maintenance of current satellite constellations.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In the history of satellites, since the launch of first satellite Sputnik in 1957, around 8,378
                    satellites have been sent to space, as per the data by UNOOSA. These days there are 4.994 satellites
                    in orbit, out of which only 7 are revolving around planets other than earth.
                </p>
                <p>The launch of Sputnik triggered the era of the space race and consequently, there was a growth in the
                    number of satellites launched which continued to peak till 1990. The next 2 decades witnessed crests
                    and troughs and the number of launches was at their lowest in 2005. From 2013 onwards, the numbers
                    continued to rise again primarily due to the Cubesat launches. In the next decade, the numbers are
                    expected to follow the same pattern, albeit at a steady pace.
                </p>
                <p>The top 3 launch sites are Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia( 2 101 launches); Baikonur Cosmodrome in
                    Kazakhstan( 1 734 launches); and Cape Canaveral in the United States( 1203 launches).

                <h2>How many active satellites?</h2>
                <p>It may sound surprising but the majority of satellites revolving around the earth are not active and
                    operational.
                </p>
                <p>According to the data by Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) which keeps a record of the number of
                    operational satellites, out of 4,987 satellites that revolved around the earth in 2018, only 1,957
                    are operational. This means currently less than 40% of the satellites that are in orbit are
                    operational.
                </p>
                <p>The highest number of satellites last year was launched for the purpose of communications and Earth
                    Observation. Demonstration satellites came at the third spot. Companies, governments and militaries
                    were the three main users in the past year, with more than 800 satellites launched for commercial
                    applications
