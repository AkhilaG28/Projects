        <h1>WHAT IS A SATELLITE</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. For example, Earth is a satellite
            because it orbits the sun. Likewise, the moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth. Usually, the word
            "satellite" refers to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space.
        </p>
        <p>Earth and the moon are examples of natural satellites. Thousands of artificial, or man-made, satellites orbit
            Earth. Some take pictures of the planet that help meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes. Some
            take pictures of other planets, the sun, black holes, dark matter or faraway galaxies. These pictures help
            scientists better understand the solar system and universe.</p>
        <p>Still other satellites are used mainly for communications, such as beaming TV signals and phone calls around
            the world. A group of more than 20 satellites make up the Global Positioning System, or GPS. If you have a
            GPS receiver, these satellites can help figure out your exact location.</p>

        <h2>Why are satellites important?</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>The bird's-eye view that satellites have allows them to see large areas of Earth at one time. This ability
            means
            satellites can collect more data, more quickly, than instruments on the ground.</p>

        <p>Satellites also can see into space better than telescopes at Earth's surface. That's because satellites fly
            above the clouds, dust and molecules in the atmosphere that can block the view from ground level.</p>

        <p>Before satellites, TV signals didn't go very far. TV signals only travel in straight lines. So they would
            quickly trail off into space instead of following Earth's curve. Sometimes mountains or tall buildings would
            block them. Phone calls to faraway places were also a problem. Setting up telephone wires over long
            distances or
            underwater is difficult and costs a lot.</p>

        <p>With satellites, TV signals and phone calls are sent upward to a satellite. Then, almost instantly, the
            satellite can send them back down to different locations on Earth.</p>

        <h2>What Are the Parts of a Satellite?</h2>
        <p>Satellites come in many shapes and sizes. But most have at least two parts in common - an antenna and a power
            source. The antenna sends and receives information, often to and from Earth. The power source can be a solar
            panel or battery. Solar panels make power by turning sunlight into electricity.</p>

        <p>Many NASA satellites carry cameras and scientific sensors. Sometimes these instruments point toward Earth to
            gather information about its land, air and water. Other times they face toward space to collect data from
            the
            solar system and universe.</p>

        <h2>How Do Satellites Orbit Earth?</h2>
        <p>Most satellites are launched into space on rockets. A satellite orbits Earth when its speed is balanced by
            the pull of Earth's gravity. Without this balance, the satellite would fly in a straight line off into space
            or fall back to Earth. Satellites orbit Earth at different heights, different speeds and along different
            paths. The two most common types of orbit are "geostationary" (jee-oh-STAY-shun-air-ee) and "polar."</p>

        <p>A geostationary satellite travels from west to east over the equator. It moves in the same direction and at
            the same rate Earth is spinning. From Earth, a geostationary satellite looks like it is standing still since
            it is always above the same location.</p>

        <p>Polar-orbiting satellites travel in a north-south direction from pole to pole. As Earth spins underneath,
            these satellites can scan the entire globe, one strip at a time.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Why Don't Satellites Crash Into Each Other?</h2>
        <p>Actually, they can. NASA and other U.S. and international organizations keep track of satellites in space.
            Collisions are rare because when a satellite is launched, it is placed into an orbit designed to avoid other
            satellites. But orbits can change over time. And the chances of a crash increase as more and more satellites
            are launched into space.</p>

        <p>In February 2009, two communications satellites - one American and one Russian - collided in space. This,
            however, is believed to be the first time two man-made satellites have collided accidentally.</p>

        <h2>What Was the First Satellite in Space?</h2>
        <p>Sputnik 1 was the first satellite in space. The Soviet Union launched it in 1957.</p>
